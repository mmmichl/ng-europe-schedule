# ng europe schedule app

Started as a small hack to get the basics of Angular2, it ended up to be somewhat useful during the conference. 
So I share this pile of not so nice code so you can try it on your own, if you want - and on your own risk ;).
Last thing to say, the design is on purpose aweful ;D 

## Install

You need [Ionic 2](http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/): `npm install -g ionic cordova`

Inside the project folder:
install dependencies: `npm install`
serve `ionic serve`
run on android device (install ;): `ionic run android`
run on ios (not tested): `ionic run ios`

Have fun ;)
